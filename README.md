These are my personal QuickCSS rules for making Discord more bearable to look at. Very Opinionated. Angry and foul language included.

Half of these won't work if your UI language isn't English. Should be easy changes if you know anything about CSS, just look for the selectors using `aria-label`.

Use it, use parts of it, change it, do whatever, as per the [License](LICENSE).

Just remember that modded clients are against Discord TOS, so use them at your own risk.
